    1. Startup Advocate: Students who choose the Startup Advocate path must complete Technical Training and refer 30 accepted applications to Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub using their contributor IDs.
        
    2. Community Builders: Students who choose the Community Builder path must complete Technical Training and reach 1,500 net-new modules completed from Cloud Skills Challenges hosted under their Contributor IDs. After you get your contributor ID you need to add it to the challenge you host and that challenge should have 1500 net new modules. You also need to fill up a form to get the link you will share.
        
    3. Community Influencer: Students who choose the Community Influencer path must complete Technical Training and reach 2,000 unique visitors to Microsoft website pages using their Contributor IDs. After getting your contributor ID, you need to add it to 10 links that are available and get 2k unique views.
